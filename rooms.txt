0F:
: Entryway
	[Antechamber]
	- Dusty. No draft.
	- Door: Looks old but won't budge.

: Antechamber
	[Stairway:1F, Hatch: -1F, East Hall, West Hall]
	- Smells distractingly of peat moss
	- Spiderwebs on the chandiler
	- Fireplace: Full of ashes, but logs are nearby.
		- Light: Turns this area into a healing zone
	- After Darcy note:
		- You hear a shriek and a thud as a body falls from the balcony above you
		- Boss fite.

: East Hall
	[Antechamber, Boudoir, Kitchen, Dining Hall]
	- Water damage runs down the wallpaper. It peels
	- Vase: at the end of the hallway on a small end table. Full of water
		You see something small in the bottom
		- Fish around in it:
			- You find a human finger.

: Boudoir
	[East Hall]
	- A dark cloud of something disperses as you enter the room.
	- A chair for lounging. Quite dusty.
		- Sit:
			- "You sit for a moment. Your mind feels nimbler seeing the world from a new perspective."
	- Medium circle table: On it sits two masks.
		- Choose Comedy Mask
		- Choose Tragedy Mask

: Kitchen
	[East Hall, Dining Hall]
	- Floor is checkerboarded proto-lineolium
	- Dishes and such are laid about, as if left mid meal-preparation
	- The room smells of terrible rot
	- Barrel: The barrel is chained shut. There is no way to open it. BTW the stink comes from here.

: Dining Hall
	[Kitchen, East Hall, Mudroom]
	- All the chairs are pulled out. It irks you.
		- Push them in
	- There are lots of plates around the table. One is much more yellowed than the rest
		- Pick up.
			- A ruined fragment of an old message: "Miss Darcy: You'll have to excuse me
			for my behavior earlier tonight. As I get older I find myself somehow more sensitive
			around topics I should be long-numb to. I would love to make up for the trouble somehow.
			Meet me in my boudoir after the procession concludes tonight. I have something to show you.
			Not once in my life did I-"

: Mudroom
	- [Dining Hall]
	- Your attention is immediately drawn to the red yarn sprawling across the floor. You can barely make out
	the floor's original tiling. Unraveled piles stretch feet tall.
		- Pull:
			- You pull on the string until the section you hold cuts itself off from the pile.
			Red Yarn Bunch.
			Slowly turns into a doll.
			Doll slowly looks more like you
