Wake up on Couch.
Couch: Can see items on table
Table:
	- Matchbook
	- Worn Silver Dagger
	- Pouch of 27g

Once you've picked everything up, rats will attack.
Kill them for coins and rat meat (edible!)
Food replenishes health and vitality (ability to heal health naturally)

Once this is over you faint and once again awaken on the couch. This time, some ambient light shines through blinds.
You are free to leave the house now. And go wherever

Be really vague with the story so it doesn't feel like loose ends are super obvious

You will not be able to purchase board at the inn. The innkeep will reject you for reasons he doesn't fully articulate.
Also, everyone treats you a little weird. Maybe really weird
